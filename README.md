I'm an ML systems and software engineer, currently focused on ML performance for constrained hardware. I'm a full-time SWE with ML internship experience seeking a long-term role. I specialize in infrastructure and systems engineering, with experience spanning the full stack from low-level optimization to application development including ML, data engineering, mobile app, and game dev.
